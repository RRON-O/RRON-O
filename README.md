- 👋 Hi, I’m @RRON-O, old as Methuselah (began with Fortran + punched tape/cards), worked all the way up to Basic (home-built Sinclair ZX80 + audio-cassette), then went elsewhere to get rich... FAILED !
- Fluent French, English & Italian; working Gaelic (Irish), Hausa, Kiswahili, Spanish & Twi (Asante); very rusty Flemish & German
- 👀 Interested in EVERYTHING ! Particularly in people & our planet.
- 🌱 Currently self-learning about EV & PHEV control systems (Outlander ECU & BMU went haywire - Mitsubishi techs unable to sort it, still under guarantee!)
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on just about anything 
- 📫 How to reach me... candotout@gmail.com
